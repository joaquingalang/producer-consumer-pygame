# 🍔 Producer-Consumer Problem in Pygame 🍴
Synchronization is a fundamental aspect of modern day operating systems. ensuring that multiple processes can execute efficiently without conflict. One of the most well-known problems of synchronization is the Producer-Consumer Problem, also known as the Bounded-Buffer Problem. This challenge illustrates how multiple processes such as producers and consumers must interact while sharing a finite buffer without causing inconsistencies or deadlocks.

This project is a graphical simulation of the Producer-Consumer Problem using Python and the Pygame library. The application serves as an interactive demonstration of synchronization mechanisms in operating systems, showcasing concepts such as mutex locks and semaphores. By incorporating visual elements, the project aims to make abstract concepts more tangible, interactive, and engaging.

### How to Use
- Use the add/subtract buttons to add producers and consumers
- Observe the results
